# Advent of Code Solutions

Welcome to my repository of solutions for the Advent of Code challenges! Advent of Code is an annual coding event featuring daily programming puzzles from December 1st to December 25th. This repository contains my solutions to these puzzles, each implemented in various programming languages. <br>


## About Advent of Code

[Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/)  offers a series of creative and thought-provoking puzzles that cover a wide range of topics, including algorithms, data structures, mathematics, and more. It's a fantastic opportunity to enhance problem-solving skills, learn new programming techniques, and engage with a global coding community.

## Repository Structure

- Each day's challenge is organized into its own directory, labeled `DayXX`, where XX corresponds to the day of the challenge (e.g., `Day01`).
- Inside each day's directory, you'll find the solution code files in ``C++``
- As a beginner I've tried to maintain clean code, making it easy to understand the approach used to solve each puzzle. There might be better approach or more clean code.

## Running the Solutions

Feel free to explore the solutions and adapt them to your preferred programming   environment. To run a solution, follow these general steps:

1. Navigate to the respective day's directory (`DayXX`).
2. Open the solution file (e.g., `Day01.cpp`) using your preferred code editor or IDE.
3. Depending on the programming language, you might need to execute the code through the command line or within an IDE.

## Disclaimer

While these solutions represent my personal approach to solving the Advent of Code challenges, there are often multiple ways to tackle each puzzle. I encourage you to experiment, optimize, and share your own solutions within the spirit of learning and collaboration.

Feel free to connect with me or provide feedback on any improvements to the solutions. Let's learn and grow together through these coding challenges!

Happy coding !
